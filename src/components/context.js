import { createContext } from 'react';

/**
 * This component initializes and stores states for global use.
 * Context holds the state for grid toggle (on/off). ShapeContext
 * holds the object state for the generated shapes so that they
 * remain on the canvas and we are able to add (and keep track)
 * the generated shapes.
